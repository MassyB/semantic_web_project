#Semantic Web Project [D&K2017]

In order ot launch the notebook use the commande below:
* **`jupyter notebook semantic_web_project.ipynb`**
 
I've used [InShowTimes API](https://www.internationalshowtimes.com/) to get the information about:
* the theaters nearby a position 
* the movies playing in a theater
* the genre/category of a movie
